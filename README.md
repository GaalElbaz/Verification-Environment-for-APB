### APB Protocol Verification Environment

Welcome to the APB Protocol Verification Environment repository! ðŸš€

#### Overview:
This repository contains SystemVerilog code for verifying an environment designed to test devices using the Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) protocol. APB is a lightweight bus protocol commonly used to connect low-speed peripherals to central processing units (CPUs) in system-on-chip (SoC) designs.

#### Code Structure:
- `apb_ram.sv`: Implements a simulated memory unit connected to the APB bus, handling read and write operations efficiently.
- `transaction.sv`: Defines transaction objects with controls, data inputs, and constraints.
- `generator.sv`: Generates transactions and populates them with random data, applying constraints.
- `driver.sv`: Drives transactions onto the APB interface, simulating write, read, random, and error operations.
- `monitor.sv`: Monitors transactions on the APB interface, capturing read and write data for verification.
- `scoreboard.sv`: Verifies the correctness of read and write transactions using a scoreboard mechanism.
